# Voice Typing System: Preserving Raw Speech

## Concept Overview

This system is designed to transcribe spoken words exactly as they are, without imposing corrections, punctuation, or standardization. It preserves the speaker’s unique voice, including accents, speech patterns, and quirks. The system consists of two main components:
* A phonetic model for raw transcription.
* A fine-tuned GPT-2 model (or similar) for mapping phonetic transcriptions to correct textual forms.

The system is intended for personal use, with a focus on adapting to the user’s specific speech patterns over time.

## Key Features

### Raw Transcription:
* Captures speech exactly as it is spoken, including accents, pauses, and filler words.
* Avoids corrections, punctuation, or modifications.

### Word-Level Mapping:
* Maps phonetic transcriptions of individual words to their correct textual forms.
* Handles homophones and ambiguities based on minimal context.

### User Control:
* The user can manually review and correct transcriptions, ensuring the output reflects their intent.

### Adaptive Learning:

* The system learns from user corrections over time, improving its accuracy for the user’s unique speech patterns.

## Implementation Plan

1. Phonetic Model

Purpose: Transcribe speech into phonetic representations.

Tools:
* Use a phonetic transcription library (e.g., espeak, g2p, or CMU Sphinx).
* Ensure the model can handle the user’s accent and speech patterns.

Output: Raw phonetic transcriptions of spoken words.

2. Fine-Tuned GPT-2 Model

Purpose: Map phonetic transcriptions to correct textual forms.

Training Data:
* Collect ~5,000 examples of phonetic-to-text mappings.
* Include diverse speech samples to cover the user’s vocabulary and pronunciation.

Fine-Tuning Process:

* Generate phonetic transcriptions for each word in the dataset.
* Pair phonetic transcriptions with their correct textual forms.
* Fine-tune GPT-2 (or a smaller model like T5) on this dataset.

Output: Correct textual representations of spoken words.

3. Data Collection and Fine-Tuning

Steps:
* Record speech samples and manually transcribe them.
* Generate phonetic transcriptions for each word.
* Create a dataset of phonetic-to-text mappings.
* Fine-tune the model on this dataset.
* Test the system with new speech samples and refine as needed.

Tools:
* Use Hugging Face’s transformers library for fine-tuning GPT-2.
* Automate data collection and preprocessing with scripts.

4. System Integration

Real-Time Transcription:
* Integrate the phonetic model and fine-tuned GPT-2 into a real-time transcription pipeline.
* Ensure low latency and smooth performance.

User Interaction:
* Allow the user to review and correct transcriptions in real time.
* Use manual corrections to further fine-tune the model.

## Expected Challenges and Solutions

### Phonetic Model Accuracy:

Challenge: The phonetic model may struggle with certain accents or speech patterns.

Solution: Experiment with different phonetic transcription tools and preprocessing techniques.

### Handling Homophones:

Challenge: The system may confuse words that sound the same (e.g., "there" and "their").
Solution: Incorporate minimal context to resolve ambiguities without overcorrecting.

### Data Collection Effort:

Challenge: Collecting and curating 5,000 examples can be time-consuming.
Solution: Automate parts of the process (e.g., generating phonetic transcriptions) and focus on high-quality data.

### Fine-Tuning Complexity:

Challenge: Fine-tuning GPT-2 requires technical expertise.
Solution: Use pre-trained models and libraries (e.g., Hugging Face) to simplify the process.

## Timeline and Milestones
Week 1-2: Set up the phonetic model and test it with speech samples.
Week 3-4: Collect and preprocess ~5,000 phonetic-to-text examples.
Week 5-6: Fine-tune GPT-2 on the dataset and evaluate its performance.
Week 7-8: Integrate the models into a real-time transcription system.
Week 9+: Test, refine, and iterate based on user feedback.
